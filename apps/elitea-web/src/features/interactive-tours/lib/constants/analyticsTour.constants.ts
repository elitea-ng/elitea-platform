- **Quick presets** — **Today**, **Last 7d**, **Last 30d**, **Last 90d**; each covers whole calendar days, from 00:00 on its first day to 23:59 today, and the page loads with **Today** pre-selected
- **Custom range** — set a precise **From / To** window (for example the last 24 hours); the **Custom** selector appears while one is active

Data is cached for up to 5 minutes.`,

- **TEAM** — active members vs. all users ever seen in the project
- **AI ACTIVE** — users with at least one LLM, tool, or agent event; includes an adoption rate
- **LLM CALLS** — total AI model invocations
- **TOOL RUNS** — total tool executions
- **CHAT MSG** — total user messages sent in chat
- **AGENT RUNS** — total interactions with agents and pipelines

Below the cards: a **Daily Activity** area chart, a **Top 5 AI Adopters** leaderboard, and a **Model Usage Breakdown** table. Click any user in the leaderboard to open their detailed view.`,

The **Agent Activity** table lists all agents with total events, distinct users, average latency, and error count. Click any agent row to open a drill-down with daily usage trends, a per-user breakdown, and the tools called by that agent.`,

The **Tool Details** table lists all tools with call count, distinct users, average latency, and error count (highlighted in red when > 0). Click any tool row to see daily usage trends, the users who triggered it, and the agents that invoked it.`,

The **Health by Event Type** table shows error rate and average latency for each event type (\`api\`, \`socketio\`, \`llm\`, \`tool\`, \`agent\`, \`rpc\`). Error rates above 5% are highlighted in red.`,

Start here if you are new to Analytics or need to verify how a specific number is calculated.`,
